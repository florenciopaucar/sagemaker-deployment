As you continue to complete and execute notebooks you will eventually fill up this disk space, leading to errors which can be difficult to diagnose. Once you are completely finished using a notebook it is a good idea to remove the files that you created along the way. Of course, you can do this from the terminal or from the notebook hub if you would like. The cell below contains some commands to clean up the created files from within the notebook."
